# gokissdb

Go KissDB is a golang riff on Adam Ierymenko's ultra simple, open licensed Key
Value store [KissDB](https://github.com/zerotier/kissdb).

As much as learning how a basic K/V store works, this is an opportunity to get
better at Go and develop a platform for data storage for the [Analytic Kata](https://github.com/nryberg/analytic-kata.git) learning series.  

Goals include reasonable compatibility with Adam's KissDB, speed and simplicity.
